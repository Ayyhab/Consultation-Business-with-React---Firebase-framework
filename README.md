# Consultation Business with React & Firebase framework
 Developed a Consultation Booking Web Application using React with a Firebase database, providing a seamless experience for both clients (teachers) and customers (students). Key features of the project include:  Profile management: Users can create and manage profiles as clients or customers, with clients (teachers) offering available consultation slots, while customers (students) can browse and book appointments. Google login integration: Implemented a secure and easy authentication process through Google Login, simplifying the sign-in process for users. Payment system: Integrated a secure payment method using Visa and credit cards, enabling customers to complete their transactions with ease. Real-time data management: Utilized Firebase for real-time updates, data storage, and authentication, ensuring smooth interaction between clients and customers. This project highlights my proficiency in React, Firebase, and payment gateway integration, and demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack application that is both functional and user-friendly.
